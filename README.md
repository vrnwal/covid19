Analysis and Prediction of Covid-19 in the United States

In this Notebook, I analyze COVID-19 Data in the United States from the month of May 2020.
Some of the questions that we pose are:
  1. We attempt to find the correlation between the medical conditions surrounding an individual and their risk of death following a coronavirus infection. 
  2. Whether it is possible to forecast COVID-19 Cases using previous growth trends. 
  3. We also attempt to identify whether political ideologies in a state play a role in the COVID-19 Progression in a State.
  
A detailed paper articulating our questions, analysis and result can be found in the PDF document in the repository.
